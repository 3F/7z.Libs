## Briefly about [7z.Libs](https://github.com/3F/7z.Libs)

Our [nuget.org/packages/7z.Libs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/7z.Libs/) is available for everyone starting from 2015. It was designed and distributed specially for [vsSolutionBuildEvent](https://github.com/3F/vsSolutionBuildEvent) and for other related purposes.

[7z.Libs](https://github.com/3F/7z.Libs) repositry **does not include** anything from 7-zip (www.7-zip.org) and only represents a fully automated distribution of the 7-zip libraries.

Everything was automated using the following tools:

* [vsSolutionBuildEvent](https://github.com/3F/vsSolutionBuildEvent)
* [hMSBuild](https://github.com/3F/hMSBuild)
* [GetNuTool](https://github.com/3F/GetNuTool)

It has been finally opened for everyone as part of https://github.com/3F for more open way!

## .NET 7-zip 

Most progressive use of 7-zip in .NET is possible through ðŸ§¬ **[Conari](https://github.com/3F/Conari)**

As for project ðŸ—¦ðŸŒ” [LuNari](https://github.com/3F/LuNari), it was planned in the past as **[N7z](https://github.com/3F/N7z)**

Today I have the priority to review this tasks not earlier than after IeXod -> MvsSln projects.

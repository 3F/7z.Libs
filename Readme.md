[`gnt`](https://3F.github.io/GetNuTool/releases/latest/gnt/)` 7z.Libs` [[?](https://github.com/3F/GetNuTool)]

Build and use from source:

```bat
git clone https://github.com/3F/7z.Libs.git src
cd src
build & cd bin\Release\raw
```

Note: the build script is configured to use [*.version*](.version) by default. Use `--target-version` to build specific version, e.g.:

```bat
build --target-version 24.08.0
```

## Why 7z.Libs

[nuget.org/packages/7z.Libs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/7z.Libs/) is available for everyone starting from 2015. It was designed and distributed specially for [vsSolutionBuildEvent](https://github.com/3F/vsSolutionBuildEvent) and for other related purposes.

[7z.Libs](https://github.com/3F/7z.Libs) repository **does not include** anything from 7-zip (**www.7-zip.org**) and only represents a fully automated distribution of the 7-zip libraries.

Everything was automated using the following tools:

* [vsSolutionBuildEvent](https://github.com/3F/vsSolutionBuildEvent)
* [hMSBuild](https://github.com/3F/hMSBuild)
* [GetNuTool](https://github.com/3F/GetNuTool)

### Preferences

MSBuild Property / Environment variable | native C/C+ | .NET    | Default value | Description
----------------------------------------|-------------|---------|---------------|------------------
`NG7zLibsCopyToOutput` | ✔ | ✔ | true | To prevent copying into output path, set as **false**
`NG7zLibsDir32bit` | ✔ | ✔ | x86 | Custom folder name for 32-bit modules if NG7zLibsCopyToOutput=true
`NG7zLibsCopyLicense` | ✔ | ✔ | true | Provide .txt licenses along with modules if NG7zLibsCopyToOutput=true
`NG7zLibsResolvePublish` | - | ✔ | true | Resolve the *Publish* target
`NG7zLibsRootPkg` | ✔ | ✔ | - | Root path to the **7z.Libs** package. E.g. path to tools like $(NG7zLibsRootPkg)tools\
`NG7zLibsLimitToPlatform` | ✔ | - | legacy | Limit copying x86/x64 modules to specific platform. Values: legacy, true, false
`NG7zLibsLimitToPlatform` | - | ✔ | false  | Limit copying x86/x64 modules to specific platform. Relies on `PlatformTarget`

7z.Libs is possible to use in managed projects (.NET, etc.) through Conari engine https://github.com/3F/Conari or SevenZipSharp, and so on.

## .NET 7-zip

Most progressive use of 7-zip in .NET is possible through **[Conari](https://github.com/3F/Conari)**

As for project [LuNari](https://github.com/3F/LuNari), it was planned in the past as [N7z](https://github.com/3F/N7z)

However, I have the priority to review this tasks not earlier than after IeXod -> MvsSln projects. Read more about on reddit and Follow the news;
